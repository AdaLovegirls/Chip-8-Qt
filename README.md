Emulator is complete, but debugger is still very much a work in progress. Currently it only shows the disassembly. Running and single-stepping work, but not breakpoints yet. Registers and stack are editable however.

Credit for the assembler and disassembler go to [aimktech](https://github.com/aimktech/chip8)!
